# ssj_latbin

A library which creates a machine-learning-ready Defense Meterology Satellite Program auroral particle precipitation (SSJ) dataset.

Data is reduced from raw data as follows:

1. The 19 SSJ energy channels are grouped in 'bands', by default "hard" (particle kinetic energy >1keV) and "soft" (particle kinetic energy <= 1keV) 
2. Uncertain (low detector count) measurements are discarded using flexible threshold (settable in configuration file)
3. The remaining measurements from all channels in a given band are summed 
4. Data is grouped by orbit (in the ML-ready dataset these would be the 'samples')
5. Data from each orbit is divided into latitude bins and the average flux in each bin is calculated (each bin is a 'feature' in the ML-ready dataset)
 
Takes Level 1B NASA Common Data Format (CDF) SSJ files (Redmon et al. 2017) from [NASA CDAWeb](https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/dmsp/dmspf13/ssj/precipitating-electrons-ions/) and produces the latitude-and-orbit binned data in Apache Parquet format.
